Many tasks on our daily life require to expand or contract our focus. When threading a needle or hearing someone in a noisy room. When watching football, our attention might expand to all the action on the field. Although we do have some control, without training our scope tends to change automatically. \n \n An expanded scope can include more things in attention. It can be useful for multitasking. Yet, when weâ€™re trying to have stable attention a scope that keeps expanding will let in distractions. Determining the scope will be cultivated in stage six.",
